# PathFinder
PathFinder is an UAV algorithm model made for making a UAV work inside an GPS detained environment.

Brief Description:
UAV are being used in many areas of the work like in Defence UAV Drones are being used to carry many defence based opperations, For Household work there are many automated robots such as Smart Vacum cleaner for cleaning the house without any partivular direction given.
But the problem arrises when there are no GPS connectivity to create an path for the UAV to work.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to make an working algorithm through which UAV can work in an GPS denied environment using camera data only and to get the live feed at the ground station.

Technology Used:
For this, we have used python programming language to access Open CV , Pickle, socket , struct and vSLAM module.
Open CV module is used to get the data and access camera in an remote device.
vSLAM is Visual simultaneous localization and mapping is an refers to the process of calculating the position and orientation of a camera, with respect to its surroundings, while simultaneously mapping the environment.
